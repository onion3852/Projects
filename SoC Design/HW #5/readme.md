Design an AHB-compatible SRAM controller for single data only

Write a testbench to do the simulation as follows
  1. Write the following data to address 00x
     0000_1111
  2. Read the data from the address 00x
  3. Write the following data to address 01x
     0000_1110
  4. Read the data from the address 01x

Submit 0) AHB-compatible SRAM controller DUT
       1) Testbench
       2) Simulation Output WAveform

This time, you must feed testvector from "in.txt" file, and save the content of SRAM in "out.txt" file
